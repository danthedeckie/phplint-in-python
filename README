This is a for-fun / for-education PHP linter / tester, written in Python.

I got fed up with cleaning up PHP, trying to make it work nicely.  I want something like gofmt for PHP, and none of the other options out there seem quite production-ready yet.

Not that this one is, mind you.

It's currently work in progress, somewhat messily written (sorry!), and still has a long way to go.

There are some bugs, but I'm working on them.

The intention is that this can either be run as a 'make sure my php is well formatted' before committing, or else to clean up a load of legacy code and format it correctly.
